## Core Features:

- Sidebar Navigation: Implements a persistent sidebar navigation visible on all pages, with a button to collapse and uncollapse the sidebar. Designed to be responsive and adapt to any screen.
- Responsive Design: Creates a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the sidebar and content area display correctly on different devices.
- Customizable Sidebar: Allows users to customize the sidebar with their preferred colors and fonts.
- AI Suggestions: Uses an AI tool to suggest relevant content or navigation links based on user activity and history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey stability and confidence. This color creates a calm yet focused environment.
- Light Gray (#EEEEEE), which provides a neutral background that highlights the blue and accent colors, improving readability and visual appeal.
- Soft Lavender (#C5CAE9) to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- 'Inter', sans-serif. Modern, clean, and highly legible, ideal for both the sidebar menu and main content.
- The sidebar should occupy the far left corner of the screen. On large screens, it should be permanently visible, while on small screens it collapses and becomes a hamburger menu.
- Smooth transitions and animations when collapsing or expanding the sidebar. A subtle swipe animation when navigating between pages creates a seamless user experience.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a set like Material Design Icons for sidebar navigation. These icons should be easily recognizable and match the overall style of the app.
